# AWK DSML
## OVERVIEW
A model for the AWK programming language. AWK is commonly paired with GAWK, which is the GNU implementation of the AWK programming language and is a standard system admin tool available in most Linux distributions. AWK is a very powerful language containing a number of constructs that give users fine-grained control when it comes to the languageâ€™s primary purpose: how data from a file system can be handled, manipulated and formatted. It is specialised to deal with text files organised in columns and provides various tools ranging from pattern matching to report generation.
